# AI-Based Air Quality Prediction System

This project is developed as part of the **AI for Sustainability Virtual Internship (1M1B & AICTE)**.

## Problem Statement
How might we use Artificial Intelligence to predict air pollution levels so that cities can take early action to protect public health and promote sustainability?

## SDG Alignment
**SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities**

## Solution Overview
A machine learning regression model is used to predict PM2.5 air quality levels based on pollution parameters such as PM10, NO, NO2, SO2, and CO.  
A Flask-based web interface allows users to input values and view predictions.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- HTML & CSS

## Demo
The application was tested locally and demonstrated using screenshots.

## Note
Due to file size limitations, datasets and trained model files are excluded from the public repository.
